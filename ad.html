      <h1>AD Campaign</h1>
      <h1>Campaign on Importance of Voting</h1>

      <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <li>
          To develop understanding in students of why Voting is important.
        </li>
        <li>
          Introduction of voting system to students.
        </li>
        <li>
          To build interest in general public so as for them to represent their selves by voting.
        </li>
        <li>
          To create awareness about NOTA.
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>

        </li>

        <h2>Planning</h2>
        <h3>Creative Strategy</h3>
        <li>
          <b>Every Single Vote Is Significant:</b> Needless to say, every citizen’s vote is counted in
the polling process. If the people are equally divided between two candidates, one
single vote can be a game-changer and a decisive factor. We have seen in the past
how one vote from an MP can decide the fall of the government. Exactly the same
way, a single person’s vote can confirm the win/fall of an aspiring MP or MLA.
        </li> <br>
        <li>
          <b>Origin of the Change:</b> Apart from the protests, voting is a highly effective medium to
have the change that we want in the government. Our nation has already witnessed
how a non-performing government gets dethroned by the spirit of wanting a change.
In recent years, there is a considerable rise in the voting percentage and people truly
love to be the ‘Change Makers’. Isn’t it exciting that a person can choose the leader
of the country right from the age of 18?
        </li> <br>
        <li>
          <b>Non-choosers get NOTA:</b> At times, it is possible that one does not want any single
candidate to be elected from all who are contesting. The election commission has
made a special provision of NOTA. It stands for none of The Above. Hence if none of
the candidates fit into your criteria, just hit the NOTA option and voice the opinion.
Introduction of this alternative is believed to play a significant role in the future. In
the late future, it may also be possible that the NOTA will decide the re-elections
with fresh candidates
        </li> <br>
        <li>
          <b>A Sense of Pride:</b> We must honor the right of voting given by the constitution of
India. The youngsters are well excited to exercise their right to vote as soon as they
turn 18. The feeling after having cast a vote infuses a sense of pride for being a
responsible citizen. As can be witnessed from the sharing of the inked finger on
social media. The trend is continuing to gain popularity amongst the Youngers and
the elders as well.
        </li> <br> <br>
